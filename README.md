# Welcome to Germ Theory
=======
Germ Theory is an application that provides real time, individualized risk assessments related to disease outbreaks.  The Germ Theory Mobile app offers an interface for users to examine known outbreak locations in their neighborhood, view their risk of infection based on where they have been, and get information about common diseases.

On the web, Germ Theory leverages its vast data sets to give public health officials administrative privileges to interpret and analyze disease data. A simple command can determine the risk of infection based on user locations.  Germ theory uses a unique algorithm to index risk and deliver compelling risk assessments.
